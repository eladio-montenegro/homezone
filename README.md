## Background

On any given day, there are nearly 443,000 children in foster care in the United States. In 2017, more than 690,000 children spent time in U.S. foster care. On average, children remain in state care for nearly two years and six percent of children in foster care have languished there for five or more years.

It is hard for kids and teens to get acclimated to a new foster home. They usually know nothing about what the home is like, who the people are, or what the house rules are . They also are uncomfortable to share information about themselves with new people in a regular conversation and it is an emotional burden to continue reintroducing yourself when you move from home to home when already distressed from being separated from your family.They also don’t know how to behave. Many kids are shy about sharing their thoughts and feelings with foster parents and end up feeling resentful when their needs are not met.

Foster parents are also in a predicament. They are often not given enough or any information about a child other than their age. One of the most common points of anxiety for parents is being prepared for encouraging good behavior and preventing bad behavior. It is often a challenge to develop a clear system of rewards and discipline that is effective and easy to implement.

## Competitor Apps
While there are apps for parents on the market not of them involve gamified behavior regulation or information exchange.

The closest competitive app is Cozi Family Organizer which keeps to do lists, grocery lists,recipes and events.

## Other apps:
Foster Care to Success: an online portal for foster youth trying to navigate college
Foster Club: an online community and resource guide for current and former foster youth
iFoster: an online hub for foster families, foster care professionals and youth, which provides, among other things, a “Digital Locker” where foster youth can store all their vital records
Think of Us: a website that helps foster youth make decisions about their future in health and work
Persistence Plus: a mobile app that “nudges” foster youth along as they try to matriculate through colleges, which relies heavily on text messages.
Talkspace: will connect you with a licensed therapist
 Life360 is for the parent who is just trying to keep up with where their kids are at any given moment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
